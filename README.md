  # Problem Definition
  * What attributes affect the laptop's prices the most?
  * Can we predict the price of a laptop given those attributes?

# Models Used
 1. Linear Regression
 2. Neural Network
 3. Random Forest Regression
 4. KNN Regression

# What did we learn from this project?
* Lower MSE does not necessarily lead to better predictions
* Neural Network using Keras and Tensorflow
  * Normalising using Log function
* Random forest Regression
* KNN regression
  * Bagging
